# Module-1
# Motivation
The motivation for this module was to clean up the source code and use semantic functions to create a more organized workflow. 
# Problem
The problem we solved by organizing the source code was to make it easier to understand and work through.
# What I learned
I learned that combining classes in css to eliminate uneeded code helps make things easier to read. also I learned that there are many ways to complete certain tasks although there are some better than others. Although I struggled with this project I feel I learned alot and it helped me get a grip on certain areas where i was struggling.
